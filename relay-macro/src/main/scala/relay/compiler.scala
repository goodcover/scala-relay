    * Buckle up.

    * This is a dummy function that basically acts as a marker so that the js type generation can process
    * the GQL statements, and this will substitute, the generated code in question.  That generated code has
    * some types attached to it to make all the scala magic work.
    *
    * it attaches a type like GQLTaggedNode[Input <: js.Any, Output <: js.Any].  This gives any sort of call
    * which needs to deal with the input or output enough information to be useful.
    *
    * HOWEVER, there are some real rules involved.
    *
    *  1) It has to be a string literal, with triple quotes, """
    *     this is because regexes are used on the js side to make this work.  Eventually we could use scala.meta
    *     to make this a lot better.
    *  2) it can't be a final val s = "foo" either. it has to be a plan string.
    *  3) You cannot use strip margin, strip margin makes it not a literal string.
    *  4) !IMPORTANT! THE WORD graphql in all lowercase must show up in the file.
    *
    * @param s plan old graphql string.
    * @return Type of the Object generated from the relay-compiler-language-scalajs
