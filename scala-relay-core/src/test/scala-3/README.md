# Scala 3 Tests for graphqlGen Macro

This directory contains Scala 3 specific tests for the `graphqlGen` macro.

## Files

- `GraphqlGenMacroTest.scala` - Main test suite for the macro functionality
- `GraphqlGenMacroErrorCases.scala` - Examples of error cases (commented out to prevent compilation errors)
- `relay/generated/TestObjects.scala` - Mock generated objects for testing

## Running the Tests

To run the Scala 3 tests:

```bash
sbtn "scala-relay-core/test"
```

Or to run only when using Scala 3:

```bash
sbtn "++3.3.6; scala-relay-core/test"
```

## Test Coverage

The tests cover:

1. ✅ Basic functionality with queries, mutations, subscriptions, and fragments
2. ✅ Complex operation names with underscores
3. ✅ Whitespace variations in GraphQL strings
4. ✅ Verification that macro generates correct object references
5. ✅ Real usage patterns

## Error Cases

Error cases are documented in `GraphqlGenMacroErrorCases.scala` but commented out since they would cause compilation failures. These include:

- ❌ Non-string literals
- ❌ Invalid GraphQL syntax
- ❌ Missing operation names
- ❌ Empty strings
- ❌ Non-GraphQL content

## Notes

- The tests use mock objects in `relay.generated` package to simulate the real generated objects
- In a real application, these objects would be generated by the relay-compiler
- The macro works at compile time, so error cases cannot be tested in unit tests (they cause compilation failures)
